![Question](images/test-3-question.png)

**Answer:**

The line chart depicts the enquiries recieved by the Tourist Information Office in the year 2011. Information recieved over the span of six months is categorized into three types based on how they were recieved.
The enquiries submitted in person have increased greatly over the period. The numbers have spiked from being the lowest during the first month to the highest among the three categories by the end. Telephone channels are also seen to have also increased in popularity. However, the use of emails and letters for enquiry have decreased by a significant amount over the span of six months.
The number of enquiries submitted in-person have risen from about 450 in January to almost 1900 enquiries in June. It is also noticable that this growth is consistant over the years with a slightly great spike between March and April.
The number of enquiries recieved via letter and email have also grown from about 900 to 1600 over the period. Lastly, the use of telephone for enquiry have decreased greatly from about 750 at the beginning month to only 150 in June.

## Writing Task 2

**Question:**

You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.

**Answer:**

Preserving the environment is a difficult yet an extremely important task. With the increasing pollution and global warming, it is high time for everyone to take be take action for preserving the environment. The statement stating that the government and large companies are only responsible towards the improvement of the environment is untrue.
Although it may be true that factories and vehicles owned by governments and large companies have contributed greatly towards the deplition of the environment, we as individuals are also accountable for many factors affecting it. Individual decisions such as how one manages their household wastes greatly impacts the waste management of a larger society when looked into at a larger scale. Likewise, even the smallest individual decisions such as the daily products one uses and the store they decide to shop at largely impacts the decisions of the governemnt and massive companies which then supposedly impacts the environment.
However, the governing bodies also hold great power that can make significant difference towards environmental development. Likewise, large corporates also have greater financial strenght and the ability to make decisions that can reduce the negative impact to the environment. It is true that the wastes produced from factories largly impact the environment and animal life. However, the wastes that come from individual households and personal vehicles also equally contribute to the environmental deplition.
Therefore, the responsibility for developing the environment goes hand in hand. Governments and large companies should be resposible towards running campaigns and creating legislations that support the environment. Likewise, individuals should be more responsible towards adapting a more environment friendly lifestyle.
