## Writing Task 2

Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

The given statement can greatly be agreed upon. While, financial help is one of the most popular ways for countries to assist each other during the time of need, many poor countries may lack proper management or may be affected by other factors that restrict them from making good use of it. Corruption is one of the biggest problems especially among the undeveloped or developing counties.
Financial aids provided by other countries can easily be exploited by the corrupted nature of a government. This may greatly impact how, or whether even if the general population of the country recieves the provided aid. Likewise, the countries providing the donations may also not see a significant impact of their giving.
There are many other ways through which a country more capable of helping can provide aid to the nations in need. Manpower, millitary support or any form of physical aid such as healthcare accessories, food, tents and many more can be provided instead of financial aid. These types of aid can be distributed directly among the population and can comparatively be more time-efficient.
However, physical aids are also not completely resistant from corruption either. There have been many cases where even such forms of aid have been used and exploited by the corrupted systems for personal benifit. Physical aid may also be more difficult to deliver as quickly as possible than financial aid. The transport of the aid can alone be very expensive and even more if it is to be provided as soon as possible.
